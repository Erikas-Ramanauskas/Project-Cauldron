            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>At the outset the player is assigned health points as well as levels for strength, agility
                    and dexterity.
                </li><br>
                <li>In each round the player will face an enemy with its own strength, agility and dexterity
                    levels.
                </li><br>
                <li>To defeat an enemy the player must fight the enemy using the Fight button.
                </li><br>
                <li>Each time the fight button is clicked the totals for strength, agility and dexterity for both player
                    and enemy at that given time are assessed. If the enemy is stronger the player loses a health point.
                    Each time prior to clicking the fight button the player can brew potions that can affect player or
                    enemy levels. This is key to the game strategy and is explained further below.
                </li><br>
                <li>The player must keep fighting until the enemy is defeated or the the player runs out of health
                    points.</li><br>
                <li>If the player health points go to zero the game ends.</li><br>
                <li>If you defeat an enemy you proceed to the next round and the health points are reset.
                </li><br>
                <li>The player also has access to ingredients in the Witches Kitchen. These ingredients can be used to
                    make potions. The
                    potions can then be used to increase your levels or decrease those of your enemy as per the
                    properties of the particular potion. The recipes for and properties of all potions are found in the
                    recipe book.</li><br>
                <li>At any point in the game a player can enter the Witches Kitchen and brew potions. The player can
                    brew a maximum of ten potions against any one enemy.</li><br>
                <li>Create your potions wisely. Win as many fights as you can. Stay alive!</li>
