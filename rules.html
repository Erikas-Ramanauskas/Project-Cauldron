                <ul>
                    <li>At the outset the player is assigned vitality points as well as levels for strength, agility
                        and
                        dexterity.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>In each round the player will face an enemy with its own strength, agility and dexterity
                        levels.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>To defeat an enemy the player must have higher levels than the enemy in each category??????
                    </li><br>
                    <li>If you defeat an enemy you proceed to the next round. If you are defeated you lose vitality
                        points
                        before proceeding to the next round. The game is over when you lose all your vitality
                        points.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>At the outset you are also assigned ingredients. As you move through the rounds you will
                        also be
                        rewarded with further ingredients. These ingredients can be used to make potions. The
                        potions
                        can then be used to increase your levels or decrease those of your enemy as per the
                        properties
                        of the particular potion.</li><br>
                    <li>At any point a player can enter the Witches Kitchen with the ingredients they currently have
                        and
                        experiment by mixing them in the cauldron to find potions. Possible potions and properties
                        will
                        be recorded in the recipe book.</li><br>
                    <li>Prior to commencing any fight with an enemy the player can mix and use a potion based on the
                        ingredients they currently have. Choose wisely. The ingredients are used up once the potion
                        is
                        used.</li><br>
                    <li>Use your ingredients wisely. Win as many fights as you can. Stay alive!</li>
