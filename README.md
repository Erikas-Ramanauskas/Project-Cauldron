## Overview
Witches Brew is a one player game against the computer. It combines elements of strategy and computer generated randomness ‚Äì or good and bad luck from a player perspective! The player commences with base levels of strength, agility and dexterity. As the game proceeds the player must fight off enemies. This will reduce the strength, agility and dexterity levels of the player depending on the nature of the enemy. However the player also starts with ingredients for potions and continues to gather them throughout the game. Different potions will affect the strength, agility and dexterity of the player or of the enemy. Brew the right potions to stay alive, stay in the game and continue to beat your enemies!!

### Development process
This project was developed with the Agile methodology which allowed us to develop the app iteratively and incrementally, and adapt changes with flexibility even in the late stages of development.

*GitHub Issues* and *Projects* are used to manage the development process.

The Project link: https://github.com/users/Erikas-Ramanauskas/projects/3

The GitHub _Kanban Board_ is used to manage the process and track the progress of the development. When User Story is created, it is automatically added to the Backlog column to be prioritized. The product Backlog is never complete, as it is a dynamic document to respond to changes effectively. As new features are identified, they are added to the product Backlog. As the product is released, the product Backlog is constantly updated to reflect changes in the product and changes in the market. The Kanban board includes the following columns:

- **Product Backlog** - the list of all _User Stories that have not yet been scheduled to be completed. As new User Stories are created, they are automatically added to the Backlog column.
- **Sprint Backlog** - the collection of prioritized User Stories that have been selected for the current Sprint.
- **In Progress** - the user stories that are currently being developed.
- **Done** all completed and tested User Stories.

The *Project Table* is used to filter and prioritize *User Stories*.
At the start of each sprint, the _User Stories_ are selected from the _Product Backlog_ and added to the _Sprint Backlog_ with attached priority labels. The *User Stories* prioritized using the MoSCoW method. The prioritization was based on the following criteria:

- **Must Have** - The *User Story* is crucial and add significant value to the product and must be delivered in the current iteration.
- **Should Have** - The User Story is important but not critical to the success. Simply delivery is not guaranteed within the current iteration.
- **Could Have** - The *User Story* is desirable and would only be delivered in their entirety in a best-case scenario. When a problem occurs and the deadline is at risk, one or more could-have items are dropped.
- **Won't Have** - The *User Story* will not be delivered in the current delivery timebox but may be considered for the future. The prioritization is based on the 60-20-20 rule where 60% of the effort is spent on the *Must Have*, 20% on the *Should Have* and the rest 20% on the *Could Have*.

## UX Design
All aspects of the UX design flow directly from the fact that the goal is the creation of a browser based game. From the moment the user navigates to the website the user should feel that they are now playing a game. Therefore the landing page does not have a navigation bar and footer typical of most information provision type sites. Instead it has a button based ‚Äúgame menu‚Äù. The menu is positioned front and centre and the user options are simple and clear. The second element is the inclusion of a colourful background in keeping with the theme of the site. This colourful theme simple navigation is repeated throughout. The pages containing the game rules and creator information continue this approach. The game itself is contained across 2 pages. These continue the overall design approach but contain increased imagery and colour. The aim is to clearly let the user know that they are now in the game proper and also to achieve the goal of providing elements to explore.
